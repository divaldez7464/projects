          <h2><strong>BENEFITS</strong></h2>
          <h3 class="benefits">1. Increases Happiness </h3>

          <p>You’ve probably heard of flow — it’s the state you get in when you’re completely absorbed in something.
            Have you ever been working on a project and completely lost all sense of self and time? That’s flow. It
            reduces anxiety, boosts your mood, and even slows your heart rate.
            It’s not just being in flow that helps your happiness. Repetitive creative motions like knitting, drawing,
            or writing help activate flow, and are all tasks that create a result. And when you succeed at creating a
            result, no matter what it is, your brain is flooded with dopamine, that feel-good chemical that actually
            helps motivate you. Whether or not you’re aware of your increased happiness, the hit of dopamine you get
            after being in flow will drive and influence you toward similar behavior. </p>

          <h3 class="benefits"> 2. Improves Mental Health</h3>

          <p>The average person has about 60,000 thoughts in a day. A creative act such as crafting can help focus the
            mind, and has even been compared to meditation due to its calming effects on the brain and body. Even just
            gardening or sewing releases dopamine, a natural anti-depressant.
            Creativity reduces anxiety, depression, and stress… And it can also help you process trauma. Studies have
            found that writing helps people manage their negative emotions in a productive way, and painting or drawing
            helps people express trauma or experiences that they find too difficult to put in to words.</p>

          <h3 class="benefits">3. Boosts Immune System </h3>

          <p>It’s time to start taking journaling seriously. Studies show people who write about their experiences daily
            actually have stronger immune system function. Although experts are still unsure how it works, writing
            increases your CD4+ lymphocyte count, the key to your immune system. Listening to music can also rejuvenate
            function in your immune system.</p>

          <h3 class="benefits"> 4. Makes You Smarter </h3>

          <p>Music lovers, this one’s for you. Studies show that people who play instruments have better connectivity
            between their left and right brains. The left brain is responsible for the motor functions, while the right
            brain focuses on melody. When the two hemispheres of your brain communicate with each other, your cognitive
            function improves.
            It’s pretty amazing that doing the activities that make us feel good (see that dopamine rush) are genuinely
            good for us. Grab a pen and start writing, doodling, or coloring. Get your hands dirty with pottery or
            gardening. Listen to some music, or pick up an instrument. Whatever you decide to do, it’s time to start
            getting creative!</p>


          <p>There are many benefits to taking a break to think creatively. Try blocking out a portion of your day to
            draw, craft, sew, etc. will make you feel better and take some stress off your shoulders!</p>

          <h3 class="benefits"> <strong>Makerspace</strong> </h3>
          <p>Loacated in the Tanimura & Antle Family Memorial Library, on the third floor, is Makerspace. This is a
            place for students, faculty, and staff to come take time out of there day to be creative and destress. The
            room has many supplies and one can create anything
            they can think of!</p>
