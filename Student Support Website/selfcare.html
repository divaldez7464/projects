      <h3>1. What Is Self Care?</h3>
      <p>Self care is a daily practice we must incorporate into our routines. When we are dealing with day to day
        stressors or larger stressors such as a pandemic and everything in between, practicing self care is part of the
        solution to the problems thrown our way. Self care includes taking into account our whole health in a holistic
        view to include emotional and spiritual health. Self care validates that you are a priority and your needs
        matter.</p>
      <p>By placing yourself as a priority, you are telling your inner self that you matter and your needs are valid. By
        honoring your own self first, you are healing the parts of you that need the most love and attention.

      </p>
      <p>Some ways to care for yourself:</p>
      <ul style="font-size: 15px;">
        <li>Taking time to appreciate and be in nature</li>
        <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
        <li>Taking a break from social media</li>
        <li>Spending time with meaningful relationships </li>
        <li>Using aromatherapy products and doing skin care</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Why Is Self Care Important?</h3>
      <p>Self care is critical in your overall wellness. Practicing self care requires you to do routine check-ins with
        yourself like you do with friends and family. It asks you to consider where you are physically, mentally,
        emotionally and spiritually, and helps you to unwind and deal with stressful situations. What you do for self
        care is unique for you and there is no wrong way to practice self care as long as you are benefitting from your
        actions.</p>
      <p>Practicing self care can help you maintain homeostasis. It can help reduce anxiety without resorting to
        medication, as well as stress or depression symptoms. When you are attuned to your needs and taking time to care
        for your overall wellness, you are better equipped to be there for others as well. It also helps to take time to
        recognize the good, and pausing to calibrate and take inventory of your life can be eye-opening.

      </p>

      <h3>3. Types of Self Care</h3>
      <p><strong>Physical Self Care:</strong>
        <br>
        This type of self care focuses on taking care of your physical health and wellbeing. This means making sure you
        get enough sleep, eat enough nutritious meals and get enough exercise. We hold a lot of tension and stress in
        our bodies even if we don’t realize it, so it’s important to implement ways in which you can relax your body and
        release that stress.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mental & Emotional Self Care:</strong>
        <br>
        This type of self care puts your mind and feelings at the forefront. This means taking time to pay attention to
        how you feel, making sure you are caring for your emotional health, taking a break from draining situations and
        giving yourself permission to end a commitment or say no.

        It’s important that you understand what your boundaries are and calibrate them if you need to in order to
        properly care for your mental and emotional health.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Spiritual Self Care:</strong>
        <br>
        This type of self care centers on faith, whatever it is you believe in. If you practice a religious faith, this
        includes reconnecting with what you believe and spending time cultivating your spiritual connections and values.
        If this is outside of religion, it means taking time to meditate, journal, or participate in any other type of
        practice that helps you align your mind, body, and spirit.
      </p>
